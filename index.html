I write blogs,work out and track my calories, and wrote a plugin for Obsidian for better note review. I find it exciting talking with clients, uncovering things that they have not seen.</span><span class="v1_33">I always go with green when it comes to color, kept a 350 day streak on Duolingo, and have taken a photo a day as my highlight ever since 2020. Knowing that days are long yet years are short, I try to learn about a new product every week, improving myself by that 1%.</span><span class="v1_34">I can sleep till 12 without an alarm, enjoy reading while lying down, and always pick the quickest meal to prepare when it comes to dinner. And perhaps that’s where my passion lies, finding solutions so others can be just as lazy, focusing their time and energy elsewhere.</span><span class="v1_35">So with all that being said, hello! My name is Sean, a junior studying information systems and human computer interactions at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am a happy person :).</span></div><div class="v1_36"><div class="v1_37"></div><span class="v1_38">One of the few selfies that I have, taken with my recitation students :D</span></div><div class="v1_39"><div class="v1_40"></div><span class="v1_41">I like to walk around / hike in my free time, a picture of my home town, Yorba Linda.</span></div><div class="v1_42"><div class="v1_43"></div><span class="v1_44">I enjoy baking here and there!
